<h2>24 Of The Best Indie Movies Of 2020 </h2>
 <i>Every year, the movies face an existential crisis and bounce back, but 2020 doesn’t look like every year. 
    <br>
    The pandemic’s dramatic impact on nearly every facet of human life has caused unprecedented 
    <br>
    damage to cultural
     institutions and the work they present. 
     <br>
     In America, most movie theaters remain closed, 
     film festivals have gone virtual, 
     <br>
     and film productions have become
     <br>
     dicey mess of insurance and safety challenges
     <br>
     that only the savviest producers can sort out.
    <br>
     Yet despite these dire challenges and the uncertainty of the future,
    <br>
    the cinema remained very much
    <br>
    alive throughout the year, 
    with a wide range of ambitious undertakings 
    <br>
    snaking their 
    way into whatever form of release seemed viable.
    <br>
    <br>
some best indie movies of 2020:</i>
 <ul>
 <li>“She Dies Tomorrow” </li>
<li>“Dick Johnson Is Dead”</li>

 <h2> Laurence anyways-a transgender story</h2>
 <i> Laurence Anyways is a Canadian romantic drama film written, directed and edited by Xavier Dolan.
    <br>
      The film competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival 
      <br>
      where Suzanne Clément won the Un Certain Regard Award for Best Actress.
      <br>
      The film also won the Queer Palm Award at the festival.

    At the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival,
    <br>
    the film won the award for Best Canadian Feature Film.
    <br>
    The film also received ten nominations at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards, including: 
 <ol>
 <li><u> Best Motion Picture </u></li>
 <li><u> Best Direction for Dolan </u></li>
 <li><u> Best Actor in a Leading Role for Poupaud </u></li>
 <li><u>  Best Actress in a Leading Role for Clément</u></li>

 <br> 
 <br> 
 </ol>

<i> When a taboo leaves the margins and inserts itself into our cultural vocabulary,
    <br>
    it takes some time before movies can deftly address it. "Pédale Douce," 
    <br>
    a 1996 French comedy about a gay bar and its patrons, felt like a checklist
    <br>
     of LGBT hot topics: being in the closet to the point of pretending you're in an "opposite marriage";
    <br>
    surrogate pregnancy; the straight women who accept you; the straight men who don't; drag shows; leather studs;
    <br>
    and AIDS. It showed the dinner parties and house parties and club parties; never a conversation where the LGBT 
    <br>
    thing doesn't come up..
    <br>

    Kokon | Trailer | Berlinale Generation 2020-DIRECTED BY Leonie Krippendorff
    <br>
    <br>

    <i>  This is nothing to do with Ron Howard’s movie about Don Ameche being rejuvenated by aliens.
        <br>
         German director Leonie Krippendorff has created a coming-of-age awakening
        <br>
        in the 2018 summer of love, with swimming-pool rapture, yearning bedroom
        <br>
        reveries and rooftop party scenes in the Kotti Kreuzberg,
        <br>
        Berlin’s Kottbusser Tor district. 
        <br>
        There are also some noodling YA-style
        <br>
        video-journaling inserts, which are an acquired taste. 
        <br>
        It’s a bit derivative and the metaphor in the title 
        <br>
         is right on the nose – but Cocoon is also seductive and well-acted.
        <br>

    <h3>How much does it cost to make a independent movie?</h3>
    <p>As of 2014, Sundance reported that the average independent film
        <br>
        budget was $750,000, and that was a conservative estimate.
        <br>
        It is possible to produce a film production on a budget
        <br>
         lower than that, but it's important to be realistic
         <br>
